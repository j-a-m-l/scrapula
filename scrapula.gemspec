    Scrapula is a library for scraping web pages that simplifies some of the
    common actions that are involved.

    It has a very simple API that can be used in several ways and contexts, and
    another, shorter, that facilitates processing pages when characters are
    scarce, like irb / pry, or quick and dirty scripts.
